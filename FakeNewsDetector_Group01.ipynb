    "We have used the following procedures: cleaning, tokenizing, removing stopwords and stemming the data. When cleaning the data we made sure of the following: \n",

    "3. all dates are written as < DATE >\n",
    "4. all emails are written as < EMAIL >\n",

    "6. all unimportant symbols are removed\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting all letters to lowercase makes it easier to compare different words. Point 2-5 are useful because it makes it possible to count the number of urls, dates, emails and numbers. Also, removing these makes sure that they are not treated as words. Removing unimportant symbols makes sure that these are not treated as words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization makes processing of the data easier, as it eliminates blank spaces and punctuations etc, making the text more homogeneous. In the tokenization process, we, for example, made all the data lower-case, thus not having two different results when processing 'Hello' and 'hello'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing stopwords is useful because these words do not help giving meaning to the documents, in other words they are noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming the data is useful because it makes sure that different variants of the same word is converted into the rood of the word. This way it is possible to make sure that two different words (same word with different endings) are understood the same way, because they actually have the exact same meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing task 2 we have used the Pandas library, nltk library and re library. The Pandas library has just been used to read the data from the 'news_sample.csv' file. word_tokenize is a sublibrary of nltk that has some useful functions for tokenizing. stopwords is a sublibrary of nltk.corpus that has some useful functions for removing stopwords. porter is a sublibrary of nltk.stem that has some useful functions for stemming data. These three sublibraries are useful because you do not need to create your own complex functions to tokenize, remove stopwords and stem the data. We have not used the clean_text library because we it did not have all the functionality needed for the task. "
